# Drop by drop: Water is not forever
Have you wondered why natural disasters have been occurring more frequently in recent years?

## Droughts

![El norte del pa√≠s es el m√°s afectado por las sequ√≠as del calentamiento global.](https://github.com/alexisoza99/nasaspaceapps/blob/main/sequia-2.jpg)

Droughts have multiple interconnected causes including climate change, population growth, water overexploitation and deforestation. Climate change alters precipitation patterns and makes rainfall unpredictable. Increased population leads to greater consumption, while deforestation decreases the ability of ecosystems to retain water and regulate the hydrological cycle. One of the most worrying factors is the reduction and variation in precipitation. According to data from Conagua, in June 2023 at the national level it rained 61% less compared to the average for the same month from 1991 to 2020. This impacted the country's main dams, which today - in the middle of the rainy season - They are on average at 44.6% of their capacity.

## Floods

Floods are temporary overflows of water onto land that is normally dry.

## Tropical storms and cyclones

A tropical cyclone is a rotating system, organized by clouds and storms, that originates over tropical or subtropical waters and has a closed center of circulation in the lower levels of the atmosphere. Tropical cyclones rotate counterclockwise in the northern hemisphere.

## Freshwater Cycle
Humanity has made significant technological advancements in recent decades. However, this development has not gone hand in hand with nature, and we need to understand how our actions can have a serious impact on our environment. For instance, some of the actions that occur daily in the world disrupt the natural water cycle:


## Water Pollution

![Hemos descuidado nuestro principal recurso h√≠drico](https://github.com/alexisoza99/nasaspaceapps/blob/main/contaminacion.jpg)

Water pollution is the contamination of water bodies, such as rivers, lakes, and oceans, by harmful substances or pollutants, which can have detrimental effects on aquatic ecosystems and human health. It is a matter of concern because it not only threatens the delicate balance of aquatic life and ecosystems but also jeopardizes our access to safe and clean drinking water, which is essential for our well-being and survival.

## Oil Spill

![Oil](https://github.com/alexisoza99/nasaspaceapps/blob/main/petroleo.jpg)

The Gulf of Mexico is the primary region most affected by these spills, experiencing the greatest impact and consequences as a result of these incidents

## Excessive water usage

Industry and agriculture are the main sectors that consume the most water.

## Deforestation

Deforestation represents an imbalance in the planet's freshwater cycle.

## Overpopulation

The primary consequence of overpopulation is the unequal and excessive consumption of resources. Our planet has a limited capacity for raw material generation, and every year the deficit of natural resources‚Äîconsumption at a faster rate than the planet can replenish them‚Äîarrives earlier.
### Environmental degradation üå±
Excessive consumption of natural resources, along with the growth in energy production from coal, oil, and natural gas (fossil fuels), is having a negative impact on the planet.
### Increased unemployment üìâ
Conversely, a high supply of workers for limited job opportunities is likely to result in high unemployment rates. This, in turn, can lead to increased crime and social unrest.
### Rising cost of living üìà
All of the above factors combined would ultimately lead to a higher cost of living in most countries: scarce resources, water shortages, overcrowding, and a lack of funds result in an increased cost of living where only a percentage of the population can meet all their needs.
### Technological advancements üë©‚Äçüíª
On a positive note, the high concentration of people in urban environments also fosters research and development aimed at addressing people's demands. This includes popularizing communication technologies, generating, collecting, and utilizing large-scale data (Big Data) for sustainable purposes, and the emergence of smart cities designed to ensure a high quality of life for their growing populations.
### Rural depopulation in favor of cities üè°
This can pose a serious problem for rural areas, leading to increasingly underutilized infrastructure due to migration to urban centers and the deterioration of ecosystems that were once tended to by humans."

## Be Conscious

It is essential to remember that our universe is an interconnected system where every action has consequences. We live in a world of cause and effect, where our decisions and actions directly impact the balance of nature and the quality of life for future generations.

We collaborate with NASA to utilize cutting-edge satellite data and advanced visualization tools. These data support our narratives and interactive experiences, providing you with a deeper and more accurate insight into the impact of climate change on the water cycle.

## Explore, Learn, and Take Action
This website not only invites you to explore the water cycle and climate change but also to learn how you can take steps to protect and conserve this vital resource. Together, we can make a difference.

Join us on this exciting journey as we explore the beauty and complexity of water on our planet and how we can ensure it continues to flow for future generations.

## WATER CYCLE

### EVAPORATION
The heat of the Sun causes water to evaporate from the oceans, lakes and streams. Evaporation when liquid water occurs on the surface of the Earth is transformed into water vapor our atmosphere.

### PERSPIRATION
Water from plants and trees too enters the atmosphere. This is called perspiration.

### CONDENSATION
Hot water vapor rises through the Earth's atmosphere. As the steam water rises, the fresh air of the atmosphere makes which condenses into liquid water, creating clouds.

### PRECIPITATION
When a cloud fills with liquid water, it falls from the sky mainly in the form of rain or snow: this is known as precipitation. The rain and the Snow fills the lakes and streams, and the process start again.

### SURFACE RUNOFF
Surface runoff is nothing more than water. "running" across the surface of the earth. The rain runs down the surface of the earth due to gravity.

### GROUNDWATERS
Some of the water seeps into the ground as soil moisture or groundwater
